                spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for

          if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way
           through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man.

              The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
              created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
              Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
              after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
              Green version was not released outside Japan
